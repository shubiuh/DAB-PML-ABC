                             Yee CRBC Library

What is it?
-----------

The Yee CRBC Library provides an interface to the complete radiation boundary
conditions of Hagstrom-Warburton (implemented as a double absorbing boundary 
(DAB) for use in finite-difference time-domain solvers based on the Yee scheme. 
It is also capable of providing these boundary conditions to wave equations 
using standard second order centered differencing methods.
